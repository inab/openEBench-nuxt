			"abstract": "The OpenEBench Software Observatory aims to be an instrument for periodically assessing and diagnosing the quality of elements enhancing research software in the Life Sciences.\n\nHere we present its latest feature, the ¨FAIRsoft Evaluator¨, for assessing the fulfillment of FAIR for Research Software Indicators for individual tools.\n\nThe evaluation is heavily based on software metadata. Users can obtain it from the Software Observatory’s database or provide a GitHub repository. In the first case, the user can select a tool from the over 45,000 bioinformatic tools, whose metadata is gathered and consolidated across eight different software registries and repositories, including bio.tools, the Galaxy Toolshed and BioConductor, among others. In the case that one prefers to use GitHub as a metadata source, the URL for the repository should be provided. Then, all available metadata will be retrieved automatically using the GitHub API. After loading the metadata, the user can edit, modify, or add more information before assessing the fulfillment of FAIR indicators.\n\nIn addition to the evaluation of FAIR, the Software Observatory allows users to download the gathered metadata or even to make a pull request to a repository of the user’s choice to incorporate such metadata as a JSON-LD file compliant with CodeMeta and Bioschemas Compute tool profile. In this way, the FAIRsoft Evaluator also constitutes an automated tool for generating software metadata following accepted standards and to enhance the interoperability of bioinformatics tools."

			"abstract": "The OpenEBench platform (https://openebench.bsc.es) has been part of the ELIXIR Tools Ecosystem platform since its inception. Despite its broad functionality, OpenEBench contributes to the ecosystem by monitoring bioinformatics tools gathered from different sources such as bio.tools, Bioconda, Galaxy and DebianMed. It also provides a set of FAIR for Research Software indicators that are periodically updated. The current model for the tool descriptions has been greatly influenced by the biotoolsSchema and has been stable for the past six years.\n\nNevertheless, the Tools Ecosystem Platform is working towards a more standard description for software tools, which led to the plan of adopting a metadata standard with broad community support being at the moment two options: Bioschemas ”ComputationalTool” Profile and CodeMeta. Considering the great degree of overlap and ongoing discussions to achieve converge and full interoperability, the OpenEBench tools monitoring platform has started the adoption of the Bioschemas ”ComputationalTool” profile. Although JSON-LD provides great semantic data representation, it greatly expands the size of the containing data. The new approach keeps storing data in a JSON format and enrich data with JSON-LD artifacts (@context, @type, @id, etc.) on the fly while preparing the response to any request through the available API.\n\nThis effort should contribute to the existing discussions in the ELIXR Tools Ecosystem platform on the need to adopt widely supported standards for describing research software and should serve as exemplar on the implications of adopting Bioschemas as a standard data model within a given platform."

			"abstract": "InSoLiTo is a graph-based network of the co-usage of research software from the tools collection hosted by OpenEBench. Co-usage is understood as being cited in the same scientific publications. The initial aim of the project is to identify how bioinformatics tools relate to each other allowing to potentially infer analytical workflows commonly used in the literature. These results can be then used by research communities organizing scientific benchmarks on popular pipelines in their domains. Interestingly, this analysis can also be extended to include widely used databases and other relevant resources as part of those workflows.\n\nData is freely accessible from a data portal (add URL) In the webpage, the user can interact with the graph network by filtering any bioinformatics’ tool stored in OpenEBench and see which other tools works with. Also, users can filter per year to see the evolution of the usage of other software in relation to the selected tool, and see which bioinformatics’ community it belongs to. Moreover, the inter- and intra-relationships between different branches of bioinformatics regarding its tools co-usage can be examined.\n\nThis addition of OpenEBench will bring a new perspective of benchmarking and monitoring research software that will complement the existing capabilities of the platform."

The infrastructure supports community-driven benchmarking, helps monitor software quality in life sciences, and contributes to best practices in research software development.\n\nComplex research software projects are frequently developed with a strong focus on technical requirements, mainly when the target group consists of developers and researchers. Focusing on technical requirements often leads to organically grown user interfaces and systems, which are difficult to use and navigate. User Experience (UX) issues can lead to a smaller user scope, potentially disappointed users, and lower content-quality perception, including hard-earned research results.\n\nWe tackle this problem by applying qualitative and quantitative user-centered design methods to OpenEBench for building a solid understanding of user needs, requirements, and context of use. Specifically, we have used user story mapping, target group analysis, interviews, personas, surveys, mock-ups, and user tests. This approach avoids costly system extensions and redesigns while offering a better, need-focused UX. We learned that, while these methods should be applied before development, an existing system's user experience can still be improved and overhauled efficiently, paving the way for a state-of-the-art user experience in research software development."

Using a set of JSON Schemas (draft 07 standard) plus some extensions, the model represents the concepts used for scientific communities during a benchmarking life cycle (e.g., benchmarking event, reference dataset, assessment metrics, etc). Labelled with permanent stable identifiers, OpenEBench holds them in a noSQL database, while providing REST  and graphQL APIs, together with the necessary tooling for data validation.\n\nOpenEBench also makes use of B2SHARE for long-term availability and storage of scientific benchmarking datasets. B2SHARE, as the EUDAT repository service for sharing research data, offers permanent storage capacity, which has permitted OpenEBench the minting of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for the benchmarking data collections, always annotated with rich and modelled metadata."

The infrastructure provides the resources to enable an objective, reproducible and unbiased comparison of bioinformatic software through metrics-based critical measurements on technical and scientific performance. Software developers are able to evaluate their tools against predefined reference datasets related to their scientific communities in organized scientific challenge events, and the computed metrics are compiled, analysed and publicly exposed.\n\nScientific communities involvement are essential for having real benchmarking activities, as they promote collaboration, transparency and harmonised standards. OpenEBench aims to support them by offering a flexible and well-established framework from which to administer and operate evaluation events for specific research domains. Community managers are trusted users, as they act as representatives for these communities. Community managers are responsible for, first, designing and developing evaluation workflows and, second, framing them into scientific benchmarking challenges following the agreements reached by their respective communities. In OpenEBench, the benchmarking evaluation workflows depend on a set of software containers which validate and evaluate the results of the bioinformatics methods under assessment by computing community-agreed performance metrics. Thus, community managers are able to integrate those evaluation workflows into the OEB Virtual Research Environment (http://openebench.bsc.es/vre) following an interactive web-based procedure whose main input are the software container-building recipes.\n\nImportantly, communities control the publication life cycle of the benchmarking challenges by which evaluation workflows are made available on the platform. In similar terms, community managers also provide different reference datasets, under public or private terms, associated with each challenge. Reference datasets are used as input for participants to generate their predictions and as golden reference when evaluating participants input data.\n\nCommunity managers are an essential figure for incorporating scientific communities into OpenEBench and maintaining its activities up-to-date once the community is integrated into the platform. Thus, OpenEBench strives to provide easy-to-use tools and mechanisms to these privileged users as part of the interactions with its communities."

OpenEBench is part of the ELIXIR Tools platform and its development is led by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in collaboration with partners within ELIXIR and beyond.\nScientific benchmarking helps determining the precision, recall and other metrics of bioinformatics resources in unbiased scenarios, which have been set up through reference databases, ad-hoc input and test data sets reflecting specifying scientific challenges. Chosen metrics allow to objectively evaluate the relative scientific performance of the different participating resources. It is even possible to understand what are the software potential biases, strengths and weaknesses and/or under which conditions do they perform better or worse.\n\nUnbiased and objective evaluations of bioinformatics resources are challenging to set-up and can only be effective when built and implemented around community driven efforts. Several communities from different scientific domains collaborate with OpenEBench in order to set-up, host and further develop their scientific efforts. Communities can focus on  specific problems, e.g. Quest for Orthologs (QfO); or having a broader spectrum e.g. Spanish Network of Biomedical Research Centers on Rare Diseases (CIBERER); or covering different challenges on each of their editions, e.g. DREAM Challenges. Benchmarking efforts led by scientific communities might have a national scope e.g. CIBERER; or a global one e.g., Global Microbial Identifier Initiative (GMI).\n\nMost communities have similar needs in terms of reference data sets, metrics, and benchmarking results accessible within the community and beyond, independently of the scientific challenges tackled by each community and their geographical scope. Data sets should reflect existing challenges of  the scientific community in terms of size, complexity, and content. Moreover, data sets are used for producing predictions by participants and to compute the performance of each participant when comparing their predictions against a previously agreed, often private, data sets that are referred many times as golden data sets. Metrics are used to measure the performance of individual participants and should reflect the common practices in the field. Finally, making results available to the community and beyond is as relevant as generating them. It is important that researchers can access these results at any time, and have the tools to assist them in understanding them. Moreover, associated data and metadata to any benchmarking efforts should fulfill the FAIR principles and be available in long-term repositories such as Zenodo and/or EUDAT with permanent digital identifiers for further use and re-use.\n\nThus, OpenEBench has engaged with different communities offering assistance to bring their previously generated data and activities into the platform. Communities can make use of any of the three available levels in the OpenEBench architecture. However, how communities use the platform depends on their specific needs and resources. To ensure the long-term sustainability of OpenEBench, we are implementing a co-production model to accelerate the incorporation of new communities and the maintenance of the existing ones."

			"abstract": "Technical and scientific benchmarking of analysis procedures are becoming key aspects of modern science. As the amount available bioinformatic software keeps increasing, the necessity for open, unbiased and reproducible challenges which evaluate the scientific and computational performance of those resources becomes more evident. For such a purpose, platforms such as OpenEBench are being developed. OpenEBench is designed to establish an automated benchmarking system for bioinformatics tools, web servers and workflows. Gathered results help users to choose the most suitable software for the problem at hand, and they provide a reference to developers when they want to improve their methods.\n\nOne of the main issues in benchmarking nowadays is the low reusability of its workflows and components, mainly due to lack of standardization, ambiguity in tools and parameters, as well as problems in sharing and maintenance. Also, the proposed workflows are usually not well specified, making it complicated to understand the flow and utilization of data. Thus, we are addressing those limitations in our infrastructure by defining reproducible and interoperable benchmarking workflows in order to make those challenges available to the scientific community.\n\nOur efforts are directed towards standardization and reusability of workflows including the creation of a benchmarking ontology. This can be achieved by standardizing the required steps any benchmark challenge needs and recommending the usage of workflow managers such as Nextflow for its implementation. We also encourage tools reusability by using software container  technologies such as Docker or Singularity. Regarding the creation and use of a benchmarking ontology, this effort will allow to provide additional metadata to the data model used in OpenEBench. Such additional metadata will facilitate the data exchange across challenges within the same community and across communities as well as it will provide a formal description of datasets and workflows.\n\nOpenEBench benchmarking workflows system has already been successfully used to run benchmarking experiments in very diverse areas such as on orthology and paralogy predictions e.g. Quest for Orthologs Consortium; and in the identification of cancer driver genes e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas’ Benchmarking group. Moreover, those workflows are supporting ongoing efforts, like some of the DREAM challenges, or the ones by the Spanish Network of Biomedical Research Center on Rare Diseases (CIBERER)."

In the context of ELIXIR-EXCELERATE WP2 OpenEBench, we consider benchmarking activities from two perspectives: the technical performance of individual tools and workflows including some quality metrics, and the scientific performance of bioinformatics resources in the context of predefined reference datasets and metrics reflecting specific scientific challenges.\n\nUnbiased and objective evaluations of those resources are challenging to set up and can only be effective when built and implemented around community driven efforts. Thus, there are several community initiatives to establish standards and services to facilitate scientific benchmarking, which provides a way for users to identify the most effective methods for the problem at hand, sets a minimum requirement for new tools and resources, and guides the development of more accurate inference methods. Importantly, those communities cover an ample spectrum of bioinformatics fields and it is not restrictive to a particular domain of knowledge.\n\nHowever, understanding the results of specific scientific benchmark approaches is not a trivial task for end-users who might not have the background knowledge to correctly interpret visualized results. Thus, it is fundamental that OpenEBench offers mechanisms to facilitate the interpretation of results by specialists and non-specialists end-users. These mechanisms include an easy to use system for switching between both users profiles. This is achieved by applying different classification techniques, which render easy to interpret tools ranking in tabular format.\n\nWe have initially used data from the Quest for Orthologs and CAMEO to guide those efforts and gather feedback about the categorization mechanisms. We aim to follow similar strategies with data provided by others community driven efforts like CAFA and/or CoCoBench."

The 2024 update brings forth a variety of new features with the primary goal of enriching user engagement and fostering collaboration.\n\nThe widgets deployed in this update represent an innovative approach to data visualization. These encapsulated packages of code empower the visualization of results effortlessly, grouping all the functionalities in a simple and visual layout. Additionally, while initially developed for OpenEBench, these widgets are designed in such a way that can be easily deployed and integrated in third-party websites.\n\nMoreover, the introduction of the OpenEBench intranet marks a significant shift towards strengthening internal collaboration and communication within users. In the 2024 release, it is possible to create and manage communities and events directly within the platform, automatizing those operations and reducing the interactions with the OpenEBench helpdesk. This initial release will capture users’ feedback, which will be used to improve this newly deployed functionality and as the basis to streamline other operations within the platform. The primary objective is empowering scientific communities to manage their own content while reducing error-prone manual operations.\n\nAs these enhancements are adopted, we expect that OpenEBench will continue to serve as an essential resource for scientific communities benchmarking activities within and beyond ELIXIR and as a framework for monitoring the research software quality across the Life Sciences community."

OpenEBench has captured an overall diversity of scientific benchmarking needs since its creation. This diversity is also present among the new communities, i.e. for long-term storage and results display (CAID), benchmarking workflow execution (LRGASP), periodic benchmarking events (QfO), or continuous benchmarking (CAMEO). Recently, there has been a noticeable increase of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software and models benchmarks and OpenEBench has swiftly responded to these demands by extending its backend and capabilities. Indeed, OpenEBench is part of future deployments across different projects, including cancer imaging benchmark for enhanced AI in oncology (EuCanImage), adoption and deployment of research software best practices (EOSC-EVERSE and ELIXIR STEERS), sex and gender biases in AI models for health applications (BAIHA), and benchmarking of multilingual natural language processing to standardise the structuring of cardiology reports across European regions (DataTools4Heart).\n\nIn addition to this diversity, OpenEBench introduces a new feature called 'Project Spaces' designed to facilitate collaboration by providing a web space where projects and communities can present their efforts, provide guidelines and share relevant information with anyone interested in engaging with them."

			"abstract": "Systematic, quantitative, and publicly accessible benchmarks are crucial drivers of progress in artificial intelligence (AI) applied to Life Sciences. In the context of the clinical care, establishing objective and transparent benchmarking methodologies becomes increasingly vital to ensure that AI datasets, algorithms, and technologies meet the standards for effectiveness and reliability demanded by the field.\nOpenEBench is being extended to accommodate new benchmarking efforts within this comprehensive open-access platform driven by scientific communities needs. Beyond facilitating the development, management, and application of standardized evaluation challenges, OpenEBench now provides access to computational resources required for evaluating AI models.\nIn the context of EuCanImage, a pan-European platform for AI application to Cancer imaging, OpenEBench supports the evaluation of the inference performance of AI models on oncological images. OpenEBench offers the necessary infrastructure, technical support, and organizational coordination to support an end-to-end benchmarking process. This includes a testing phase, where AI developers can test trained models against a given test dataset in the platform’s playground; a validation phase, where accepted models are validated against a validation dataset; a benchmarking phase, which computes assessment metrics from resulting predictions; and a final publication phase that makes metrics open to the public for comparison and further analysis.\nOpenEBench conducts these tasks transparently and collaboratively, enabling the sharing of datasets, registering and annotating participants' trained models, and leveraging state-of-the-art technologies to build secure and reproducible processing environments. Through these endeavors, OpenEBench promotes best practices in the domain, encouraging the adoption of FAIR principles and fostering progress and innovation in AI research in Life Sciences."

			"abstract": "Spanish bioinformatics community is composed of many diverse groups from research institutions and hospitals. Since 2003, Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (INB) is engaged in the coordination, integration, and development of Spanish bioinformatics resources. Its official constitution as the ELIXIR-ES node at 2017 allowed further consolidation of Spanish bioinformatics community as a part of European ELIXIR initiative. Tight collaboration amongst ELIXIR-ES participating institutes, joined development and shared infrastructure revealed the need for a federated, standard authentication mechanism that can be easily adopted by research groups in their projects. The ELIXIR Authorization and Authentication Infrastructure (AAI) provides such a mechanism for those institutions that already have their authentication service federated, for instance via the RedIRIS/EduGAIN Identity Service.\n\nINB-ELIXIR Central Authentication Service (CAS) is offered as a primary authentication service for ELIXIR-ES affiliated institutions that lack institutional Identity Provider (IdP) or are not affiliated at EduGain. Besides serving as INB-ELIXIR CAS, the service provides identity and access management for research projects that need reliable and flexible authorization scheme for their development, and can act as IdP for the ELIXIR-AAI. The ELIXIR-ES IdP service is successfully used in the ELIXIR OpenEBench Platform and Multiscale Complex Genomics (MUG) project. The projects use different OpenID Connect authentication flows for the Web-based authentication and data protection. OpenID Connect protocol usage allowed seamless integration with ELIXIR AAI and demonstrated excellent flexibility in applied scenarios."

Starlife accounts for 2160 cores and a total of 2PB of storage. Starlife hosts the Spanish site of the European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA). Offered as a PaaS-like (Platform as a Service), ELIXIR-ES Compute platform is going to support both, long running services and the automatic deployment of pre-packaged applications and pipelines. The infrastructure is linked to HPC facilities at BSC.\nServices catalog is going to include ELIXIR relying services like an EGA-external cloud , where authorized users can carry out secure data analysis, OpenEBench benchmarking framework, and the ELIXIR-ES identity provider (idP) authorization server. To access to these resources, a Single Sign On authentication, compatible with ELIXIR AAI (Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure) is going to be implemented.\nThe offer of customized compute-on-demand applications is going to be banked on a repository of images. Virtual machines are going to be deployed on the underlying OpenNebula cloud via the OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface) standards. PMES (Programming Model Enactment Service) is responsible of the automatic application deployment, managing the cloud provisioning and providing scaling capabilities to the system"

It includes one aligner, one BAM processor and one variant caller.\nMore specifically: Burrows Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is used to map NGS reads on the reference genome, the samtools and bcftools packages to process the BAM files and call variants, respectively. The tools, installed from the main Galaxy toolshed, were configured manually with Biocontainers images.\n\nContainerized workflows provides a prominent advantage: the same fine tuned steps of the computation can be available to each site that requires them and can be replicated even if the execution environments differ.\nThere are, however, few issues still to be addressed: potential version mismatch caused by manual tool configuration, and the potential incompatibility between the command line specified in the Galaxy tool and the container.\nBoth issues are being worked on by providing automatic container creation via Conda, Mulled and Involucro.\nIn this way the exact same version and container will be used transparently (still beta at the moment of writing).\n\nThis proof-of-concept workflow is a stepping stone towards an effort in benchmarking different workflow managers in executing a well established variant calling pipeline. The same workflow will be implemented in NextFLow, CWL and Galaxy and the tools included in the workflow will run in containers.\nThe results will be available in OpenEBench."

CAMEO[1] is hinged on the weekly PDB pre-release of amino acid sequences as part of the PDB release of experimentally determined macromolecular structures. Typically, 20 protein sequences are selected as the target set and submitted to the participating servers for CAMEO 3D and CP categories. For CAMEO QE model coordinates of the CAMEO 3D servers are subsequently submitted. All servers return predictions to CAMEO until the following Wednesday. For the evaluation, the coordinates released by the PDB are used as reference, and the assessments are then published on cameo3d.org for interactive performance analyses.\nFor CAMEO 3D 6736 targets were evaluated over 375 weeks, rapidly accumulating data for testing new developments on unseen and independent data.\nThe CAMEO team contributed to the development of the community-agnostic data model within OpenEBench[2], allowing unified access to benchmarking data. The CAMEO workflows have recently been ported to NextFlow, resulting in a more robust and parallel setup to run on e.g. OpenEBench resources.\nCAMEO evaluates various aspects of protein structure modeling with different scores. The developers of prediction servers benefit of rapid assessment of new developments and continuous monitoring of their public servers, thereby complementing the bi-annual CASP effort[3]. CAMEO allows life scientists to better understand which public modeling server is the most suited for their specific use case."

Associated metadata to research software enables discovering, understanding and utilizing software. However, metadata tends to be sparse and frequently inconsistent across different resources.\n\nThe ELIXIR Tools Ecosystem (TEc) aims to act as a proxy to maintain and preserve high-quality metadata for describing research software. To make this possible, the TEc works closely with heterogeneous metadata resources. These resources often have different objectives, user communities and technical implementations. The goals of the TEc are to bring metadata together, facilitate integration, curation, and re-usability by the contributors and anyone willing to consume the metadata produced in this context.\n\nThe TEc currently focuses primarily on the Services associated with the ELIXIR Tools Platform, that gather, curate, maintain and consume high-quality metadata associated with research software. Specifically, the Tools Ecosystem includes bio.tools, BIII.eu, Biocontainers, OpenEBench, Galaxy, and WorkflowHub, and EDAM as the ontology for describing research software metadata. Additionally, multiple resources driven by other infrastructures and communities are included in our efforts, such as Bioconda and Debian (Med).\n\nAs an open source project bringing together under the same umbrella different projects and initiatives, the TEc follows the guidelines, recommendations and standards put forward by ELIXIR, and other community-driven initiatives in the scope of open science."
